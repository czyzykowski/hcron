# hcron

A simple job scheduler for Haskell, which just runs some IO () action
at a given time.

Currently, most of the code is just a copy of the excellent cron package
found in the BuildBox package (http://hackage.haskell.org/package/BuildBox)
by Ben Lippmeier, slightly adjusted to execute arbitrary IO () actions.
